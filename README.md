A Python programmable G-Code generator for milling machines,  
including a minimalistic OpenGL preview.  
Well, er... Parts of :)

I restored these Python fragments from an old CPIOed backup tape.  
The only thing I remember is, that I implemented a quite cool, round
pocket milling algorithm.

As far as I can remember, that was my first contact with Python at all.  
That's also what the code looks like (o_O)

But I want that in EMC2...
